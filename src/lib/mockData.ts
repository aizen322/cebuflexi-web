    excerpt: "Plan your perfect Cebu vacation with our comprehensive guide to weather, festivals, and seasonal highlights throughout the year.",
    content: `<p>Choosing the right time to visit Cebu can make or break your vacation. Here's everything you need to know about Cebu's seasons, weather patterns, and best times for different activities.</p>

<h2>Weather Overview</h2>
<p>Cebu has a tropical climate with two main seasons: dry (December to May) and wet (June to November). However, rain in Cebu is typically brief and shouldn't deter your travel plans.</p>

<h2>December to February: Peak Season</h2>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> Cool and dry, temperatures 24-30¬∞C</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Perfect beach weather, calm seas for island hopping, Sinulog Festival in January</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher prices, crowded attractions, advance booking required</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> First-time visitors, beach lovers, festival enthusiasts</p>

<h2>March to May: Summer Season</h2>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> Hot and dry, temperatures 26-33¬∞C</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best diving visibility, perfect for water activities, summer festivals</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very hot, especially April-May, can be crowded during Holy Week</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Divers, water sports enthusiasts, sun worshippers</p>

<h2>June to August: Early Wet Season</h2>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> Warm with afternoon rain showers, 25-31¬∞C</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lower prices, fewer tourists, lush landscapes, waterfalls at their best</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Occasional rain, some boat trips may be cancelled</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget travelers, waterfall chasers, cultural experiences</p>

<h2>September to November: Late Wet Season</h2>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong> More frequent rain, 24-30¬∞C, possible typhoons</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best deals, very few tourists, green landscapes</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Weather unpredictability, some outdoor activities limited</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Flexible travelers, indoor activities, cultural tours</p>

<h2>Festival Calendar</h2>
<p><strong>January:</strong> Sinulog Festival - Cebu's biggest celebration</p>
<p><strong>April:</strong> Aliwan Festival, various town fiestas</p>
<p><strong>December:</strong> Christmas season with spectacular decorations</p>

<h2>Activity-Specific Best Times</h2>
<p><strong>Whale Shark Watching:</strong> Year-round, but best December-May</p>
<p><strong>Diving:</strong> March-June for best visibility</p>
<p><strong>Canyoneering:</strong> December-May when water levels are safe</p>
<p><strong>Island Hopping:</strong> December-May for calm seas</p>
<p><strong>Mountain Activities:</strong> Year-round, waterfalls better during wet season</p>

<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<p>For the best overall experience, visit between January and April. You'll enjoy great weather, calm seas, and the option to experience Sinulog if you come in January. However, don't rule out the wet season - you'll save money and see a greener, less crowded Cebu.</p>`,
